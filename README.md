## CS365 -- Programming Languages and Systems
Class webpage: https://web.eecs.utk.edu/~bvanderz/cs365/

[CS365 Projects](https://github.com/hkitts/Projects/tree/main/ProgrammingLanguagesAndSystems)

- [JTalk in Java!](https://github.com/hkitts/Projects/tree/main/ProgrammingLanguagesAndSystems/Java_JTalk)
- [MVC Java](https://github.com/hkitts/Projects/tree/main/ProgrammingLanguagesAndSystems/MVC_Java)

## CS370 Scientific Computing
Textbook - Numerical Methods in Engineering with Python, Third Edition by Jaan Kiusalaas
[Free Study Link](https://www.thefreestudy.com/pdf-numerical-methods-in-engineering-with-python-3-3rd-edition/)

[CS370 Projects](https://github.com/hkitts/Projects/tree/main/ScientificComputing)

These are mostly scientific computing problems from the book. They are just some examples of using python.

## CS545 Digital Archaeology

[Youtube Clickbait](https://github.com/fdac21/youtubeClickbait)
- This project used Googles API to pull video data from Youtube. Then we tried to determine if a video's title was clickbait using text analysis, a neural network, and a decision tree.

## CS420 Biolog-Inspired Computation

[Particle Swarm Optimization](https://github.com/hkitts/Projects/tree/main/BiologInspired_Computation/ParticleSwarmOptimization)
- Compares the optimization functions of Booth and Rosenbrock by testing different parameters, including: number of particles, inertia, cognition, and social.
