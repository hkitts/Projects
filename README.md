# Projects
This repository contains some of my projects I have worked on during my time at UTK.

## CS494 Advanced Programming and Algorithms

Class webpage: https://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs494/494/index.html

[CS494 Projects](https://github.com/hkitts/Projects/tree/main/AdvancedProgrammingAndAlgorithms)

- [Alice and Board Folding](https://github.com/hkitts/Projects/tree/main/AdvancedProgrammingAndAlgorithms/AliceAndBoardFolding)

- [B-Tree](https://github.com/hkitts/Projects/tree/main/AdvancedProgrammingAndAlgorithms/B-Tree)
  - Very cool but difficult project. This is an implementation of B-Tree on a disk. It uses a disk emulator similar to FAT. The B-Tree is implemented on top of the disk emulation and each node of the tree fits on one sector of the disk. Requires reading bytes, dealing with LBAs, recursion and memory management all on top of writing B-Tree algorithm.

- [Jgraph Project](https://github.com/hkitts/ps_trophies)
  - Different project that uses Jgraph written by Dr. Plank. Similar to Matplotlib, this graphing tool uses postscript and has a lot more customization options. [Jgraph Webpage](https://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/jgraph/jgraph.html)

- [File Allocation Table](https://github.com/hkitts/Projects/tree/main/AdvancedProgrammingAndAlgorithms/FileAllocationTable)

- [Floyd-Warshall](https://github.com/hkitts/Projects/tree/main/AdvancedProgrammingAndAlgorithms/Floyd-Warshall)

- [SIMD](https://github.com/hkitts/Projects/tree/main/AdvancedProgrammingAndAlgorithms/SIMD)

Class webpage: https://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs140/

[CS202 Projects](https://github.com/hkitts/Projects/tree/main/DataStructures_Algorithms)
- [AVL Trees](https://github.com/hkitts/Projects/tree/main/DataStructures_Algorithms/AVLTrees)
- [Bit Matrices](https://github.com/hkitts/Projects/tree/main/DataStructures_Algorithms/BitMatrices)
  - Bit-matrix manipulation. Ex- Add, Subtract, Multiply, Inverse
- [Fun with PGM files](https://github.com/hkitts/Projects/tree/main/DataStructures_Algorithms/FunWithPGM)
  - Create simple PGM, turn image negative, horizontal flip, and verticle flip
- [More Fun with PGM](https://github.com/hkitts/Projects/tree/main/DataStructures_Algorithms/MoreFunWithPGM)
  - Creating PGM files, reading, writing, cropping, and rotating


## CS302 -- Data Structures / Algorithms II
Class webpage: https://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs302/

[CS202 Projects](https://github.com/hkitts/Projects/tree/main/DataStructures_AlgorithmsII)

- [JTalk](https://github.com/hkitts/Projects/tree/main/DataStructures_AlgorithmsII/JTalk)
  - Uses pthreads to set up chat server
- [Superball](https://github.com/hkitts/Projects/tree/main/DataStructures_AlgorithmsII/Superball)
  - [Superball Multiplatform Player](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4rzPrfwFCsKbUpwd21pMlgtc1E/view) by Alex Treepe
  - Solve Windows 95 game. Get as many points as possible in 100 games. 
- [Word Dice](https://github.com/hkitts/Projects/tree/main/DataStructures_AlgorithmsII/WordDice)
  - Uses network flow to determine if given words can be spelled out with dice

## CS365 -- Programming Languages and Systems
Class webpage: https://web.eecs.utk.edu/~bvanderz/cs365/

[CS365 Projects](https://github.com/hkitts/Projects/tree/main/ProgrammingLanguagesAndSystems)

- [JTalk in Java!](https://github.com/hkitts/Projects/tree/main/ProgrammingLanguagesAndSystems/Java_JTalk)
- [MVC Java](https://github.com/hkitts/Projects/tree/main/ProgrammingLanguagesAndSystems/MVC_Java)
  - Moddel-View-Controller architectureal pattern in Java
- [Scheme](https://github.com/hkitts/Projects/tree/main/ProgrammingLanguagesAndSystems/Scheme)
  - Some functional programming with Scheme
## CS370 Scientific Computing
Textbook - Numerical Methods in Engineering with Python, Third Edition by Jaan Kiusalaas
[Free Study Link](https://www.thefreestudy.com/pdf-numerical-methods-in-engineering-with-python-3-3rd-edition/)

[CS370 Projects](https://github.com/hkitts/Projects/tree/main/ScientificComputing)

These are mostly scientific computing problems from the book. They are just some examples of using python.

## CS545 Digital Archaeology

[Youtube Clickbait](https://github.com/fdac21/youtubeClickbait)
- This project used Googles API to pull video data from Youtube. Then we tried to determine if a video's title was clickbait using text analysis, a neural network, and a decision tree.

## CS420 Biolog-Inspired Computation

[Particle Swarm Optimization](https://github.com/hkitts/Projects/tree/main/BiologInspired_Computation/ParticleSwarmOptimization)
- Compares the optimization functions of Booth and Rosenbrock by testing different parameters, including: number of particles, inertia, cognition, and social.
