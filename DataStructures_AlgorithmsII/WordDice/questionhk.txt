1. What is complexity of your implementation?

I think by using BFS and Edmonds-Karp my complexity is
O(VE^2). I used bfs which uses a list/queue and several
classes. One class holds the nodes, the other the edges.
Finally my canSpell class uses Edomds-Karp and repeatedly
calls BFS to look for a path. I think the total complexity
is this becasue the rest of my program just consists of
pushing back into vectors and creating node pointers.
