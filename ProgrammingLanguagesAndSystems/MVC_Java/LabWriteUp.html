<h2> Homework Assignment 6</h2>
</center>
<p>
This homework assignment will give you practice with:
</p><ol>
<li> Java's layout managers
</li><li> the MVC model
</li><li> custom drawing and event handling in Java
</li></ol>
<hr>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li> Modify the BoxLayoutDemo found in /home/bvanderz/cs365/hw/hw6
in the following manner:
  <ol>
    <li> The layout should be horizontal
    </li><li> The buttons should be divided into two groups with group 1 
      consisting of buttons 1, 2, and 3 and group 2 consisting of buttons
      long-named button 4 and 5. If the window is made bigger, group 1 should
      cling to the left side of the window and group 2 should cling to the
      right side of the window. You do not need to use two layout managers
      to accomplish this grouping--you put "something" between buttons 3 and
      4.
    </li><li> Within each group there should be 20 pixels of space between each
      pair of buttons. 
  </li></ol>
  <p>
  If you have questions about how your layout should look or behave, you
  can run my executable:
</p><pre>java -jar BoxLayoutDemo.jar
</pre>
<p>
</p></li><li> Write a Java Swing application that displays three views 
of a numeric value
that may be adjusted: 1) a slider view that contains a slider and two 
buttons,
an increment button and a decrement button, 2) a text view
that contains a label that represents the
  value of the numeric value, and 3) a gauge view that contains a dial 
that allows you to manipulate the numeric value. The program should take
 four
integers as command line arguments:
<p>
</p><ol>
<li> minValue: The minimum value of the slider
</li><li> maxValue: The maximum value of the slider
</li><li> startValue: The starting value of the slider
</li><li> increment: The amount by which the buttons increment or decrement the
  slider's value
</li></ol>
<p>
These 4 values are the model's state information and you will need to write
methods that allow the views to query these values and that allow the
controllers to change the slider's current value. Technically startValue
is not part of the model's state information but instead is used to initialize
the model's current value, which is part of the model's state information.
</p><p>
  Here are additional program requirements:
</p><p>
  </p><ol>
    <li> The increment and decrement buttons should increment
and decrement the value of the slider by the increment value.
The program should use the Integer class's parseInt method to convert the
command line arguments to integers and it should use a try/catch block to
catch a NumberFormatException if any of the four arguments cannot be 
converted to an integer. Your program should print an appropriate error 
to the console and then exit.
<p>
</p></li><li> You should position the three views using a BorderLayout
manager. Place the text view in the north (top) region, the slider
  view in the center region, and the gauge view in the bottom region.
  The slider and gauge views will have to be placed in their
own JPanels. I want the elements of the slider view to
be laid out horizontally, in the order decrement button, slider, and
increment button. There are at least three layout managers that I can
think of which will position these three elements correctly, so I will
leave it up to you to choose one. 
<p>
</p></li><li> If the user presses
the increment button and the value is already at the maximum allowable value
for the slider then the application should pop up a message dialog indicating
that the value cannot be further incremented (use the JOptionPane's 
showMessageDialog method). A similar message should be
displayed if the user attempts to decrement the value when it is already at
its minimum value. If the user attempts to increment the value and the 
increment would move the value past its maximum permissable value, then
increase the value to the maximum value, but do not print an error message.
Do the same thing for the decrement button.
  <p>
        </p></li><li> The gauge view should be implemented using a class named <tt>GaugeView</tt> and it will draw a custom
      picture of a gauge with a needle. The view should allow the 
      user to drag the needle to change the value of the model. The gauge view
      has the following requirements:
      <ol>
      <li> it should consist of an arc that extends from 3:00 to 9:00 in a
	counter clockwise direction and a line (i.e., the needle) that extends
      from the center of the arc to the boundary of the arc. 
	The arc can be drawn using the Graphic object's <tt>fillArc</tt> command. 
      </li><li> the arc must be orange and the line must be blue.
      </li><li> the user can drag the needle around the arc by pressing on the
	mouse button while the mouse cursor is closer than
	10 pixels from the endpoint of the needle and dragging the mouse cursor.
	The mouse cursor may move anywhere while the cursor is being dragged--it
	does not need to remain within 10 pixels of the endpoint of the needle.
	The needle should follow the mouse cursor around the arc and the
	needle's endpoint should stay attached to the boundary of the
	arc. 
      </li><li> Use a MouseListener
	to detect the MousePressed and MouseReleased events and 
	the MouseMotionListener to
	detect the MouseDragged event. The coordinates
	of the mouse cursor can be obtained from the MouseEvent that is passed
	to your event handling methods. The distance of the cursor from the
	endpoint of a line is given by the equation:
<pre>sqrt((cursor.x-line.x)<sup>2</sup> + (cursor.y-line.y)<sup>2</sup>)
</pre>
      </li><li> Your mouse point will probably not lie directly on the circle's
	boundary so you will have to obtain the closest point on the circle
	to the mouse point. This point is obtained by drawing a line from the
	center of the circle to the mouse point. You can use atan2 (arctan)
	to obtain the angle and then the polar coordinate equations for
	a circle will give you the (x, y) points. For those of you not
	familiar with polar coordinates, the equations are:
<pre>x = radius * cos(&#920;)
y = radius * sin(&#920;)
</pre>
	where &#920; is your angle. 
      </li><li> 3:00 on the arc represents the minimum value of the gauge.
	Values increase in a counter-clockwise direction to 9:00 on the arc.
	You can use the angle of
	the needle to determine the value of the gauge. For example, if the
	minimum value of the gauge is 0, the maximum value is 100, and the
	angle is 90 degrees (i.e., 12:00), then the value of the gauge is 50.
      </li><li> the preferred width and height of your gauge view should be 200x100.
      </li><li> the arc should be horizontally centered within its JPanel and 
	vertically attached to the bottom of its JPanel.
	
      </li><li> The diameter of the arc must be the minimum of the
	width or 2 times the height of its JPanel. You can get the width and height of
	a JPanel using the getWidth and getHeight methods. As an example, if
	the layout manager assigns the JPanel a width of 450 and a height of 
	100, then the arc's diameter must be 200 pixels, which is 2 times the
	height.
    </li></ol>
  </li></ol>
  </li></ol>

</p><h3> Designing Your Implementation </h3>
<p>
  Your implementation must
  fit the MVC model. If you are unsure of how to split
  up the code, look at my <a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~bvanderz/cs365/examples/MVC/">sample MVC application</a> that I covered in the videotape lecture. 
    Put all your files in a package named SliderApp, including the
      "Glue" file that will contain your main method. 
</p><p>
</p><h3> Layout Hints </h3>
<ol>
<li> You will need to use the setHorizontalAlignment method for a JLabel since
  BorderLayout ignores the setAlignmentX method.
</li><li> Remember that you can get gaps in a BorderLayout by using the hgap and vgap
  properties.
</li><li> If you extract the content pane from a JFrame using getContentPane, make
  sure you downcast the content pane to a JPanel, because the return type
  from getContentPane is a Container object.
</li><li> If you extract the layout manager from the JFrame's content pane, make
  sure you downcast the layout manager to a BorderLayout, because the return
  type from getLayout is LayoutManager.
</li></ol>
<h3> My Executable </h3>
   If you have questions about how your application should look or behave,
then execute the SliderApp.jar file in /home/bvanderz/cs365/hw/hw6 using
the command:
<pre>java -jar SliderApp.jar minValue maxValue startValue incrementValue
</pre>
  A sample invocation might be:
<pre>java -jar SliderApp.jar 50 100 80 5
</pre>
You do not have to get the spacing between elements exactly like mine, but
I do want the general positions to be the same, and I want the text view
centered. 
<p>
Please make sure that when the window is re-sized and made bigger that 
everything stays laid out in the manner that I specified above (centered
text view, diameter of the arc must be the minimum of the
        width or 2 times the height of its JPanel, something reasonable happens
with the slider view). In particular it is not okay for the buttons in the
slider view to stay in the same place, something needs to get resized to
accommodate the extra space. Since you may use a different layout manager
than I used, the manner in which the slider view is updated may be
different than mine but I want something reasonable to happen.

</p><h3> More Implementation Hints/Notes </h3>
   Here are a few things to which you should pay careful attention:
   <ol>
   <li>The y-axis of a window goes from the top to the
     bottom of the window. Hence in a window that is 200 pixels high, 
     a y-value of 0 occurs at the top of the window
     and a y-value of 200 occurs at the bottom of the window.
   </li><li> When trying to obtain an angle using the arctan function, you should
     use Java's Math.atan2 function rather than its Math.atan function. The
     difference is that atan2 handles the case where x is 0 (occurs at &#960;/2
     radians) whereas atan will not work if x is 0 (y/x will yield NaN and
     atan will return NaN rather than &#960;/2 radians).
   </li><li> Java's fillArc command uses degrees but its Math trigonometric functions
     use radians. You can convert back and forth using <tt>Math.toDegrees</tt>
     and <tt>Math.toRadians</tt>.
   </li></ol>

<h3> What To Submit </h3>
<p>
Submit two jar files named BoxDemoLayout.jar and SliderApp.jar. Both
should be executable and contain the source files for their problems.
