You are to solve Problem No. 15 from Problem Set 2.1 on page 57 of the textbook (see pdf file below). This problem requires the LUdecomp.py module (provided). In the prob-2-1-15.py file (which is the only one you need to submit), you will need to complete the template to do the following:

    set the tolerance
    create Matrix (a)
    create Vector (b)
    compute the LU decomposition
    produce the solution vector

See the LUdecomp.py module for the correct function calls to do the last two items.  A reasonable choice for the error tolerance variable (TOL) in the template is 1.E-6.
