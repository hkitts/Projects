You are to complete the prob6_1_14.py template script that solves Problem 14 in Problem Set 6.1 (pg. 214).  You will compute a series of definite integrals for g(u), namely for u = 0 to 1.0 in intervals of 0.05.  You are to use the romberg.py and trapezoid.py scripts provided above along with Matplotlib's Pylab module to produce a plot of g(u) from 0 to 1.0.  The graph produced should be saved to the file named prob6_1_14.png in the current working directory.  There is no need to include this output file in your submission to Canvas; we will run your script and make sure the correct file is produced. Be sure to label "u" and "g(u)" for the horizontal and vertical axes, respectively along with the appropriate title. A sample graph that you are to reproduce is provided in the prob6_1_14.png file above. You can assume g(0)=0 and not perform any integration for the u=0 case.  Scripts that do not produce a graph of g(u) will receive a 10 point deduction.  Your console output should be a table with the values of u and g(u) in which u runs from 0 to 1.0 in increments of 0.05.  Failure to provide this output will also be a 10 point deduction.
