Using the probs-3-1.py template and cubicSpline.py script, you will exploit the use of cubic splines to derive table entries for two important measurements from applied physics (the drag coefficient cD of a sphere and the kinematic viscosity μk of water).  The Python script provided should be personalized/customized  to solve Problems #17 and #19 from Problem Set 3.1 in the textbook.  The output should be a table of four values for cD followed by another table of four values for μk.
