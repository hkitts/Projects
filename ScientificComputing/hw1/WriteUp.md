For this assignment, you will be using the Matplotlib library to graph temperature data for the month of August.  Provided for you is a Python template to help you get started.  You will notice that three arrays are initialized for you already:

    xData represents each day of the month and is to be placed on the x-axis
    tData is the high temperature for each day
    avg is to be the month average up to that day

Your task is to compute the monthly average, print a table with your computed values accurate to 2 decimal places, and then plot the high temperatures and month average using Matplotlib.  The attached example_output.png provides a screenshot of what the graph should look like.  You should try to match it as closely as possible.  As for the table, the formatting doesn't particularly matter.  To help you match the graph, the template temps-1.py provides a checklist of items that need to be taken care of in the comments. You may consult the Matplotlib documentation for pyplot (Links to an external site.) to help you carry out the task.  Your output table can be simply written to stdout (i.e., to the screen as your script executes).
